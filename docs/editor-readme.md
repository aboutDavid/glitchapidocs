You can control the Glitch editor using WebSockets (with the excpetion of the terminal "API"), but these endpoints may change soon.

For the editor APIs that use websockets, currently you will need to know how to use websockets or use something like [hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/realtime/)'s realtime feature.
